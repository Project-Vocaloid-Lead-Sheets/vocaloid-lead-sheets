## Contribute software

The process is generally "check in abt intended changes; get consensus before merging":

1.  Suggest or describe your change in the `#development` channel of the Discord server
    -   If it's a particularly impactful change
        (publishing / replacing major content, adding new hosting),
        get a majority agreement of people active in the channel.
1.  Create your own **branch** in the repo
    -   Push regularly so people can keep tabs on your work
1.  Open a pull request when done. Wait for at least one or two approvals,
    then you can merge your change.
