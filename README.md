# Project Vocaloid Lead Sheets

Lead sheets of vocaloid music, for musicians to jam or learn.
This is similar to / inspired by [VGLeadSheets.com](https://www.vgleadsheets.com/),
but it is a separate project from VGLS, organized by a different community.

## Status

As of April 19, 2025:

Currently working on a minimal setup and defining a contribution process.
We have a private discord server with a small community from MAGFest 2025.
We intend to open up the community once we have a functional website
and a well-defined contribution process.

At the moment we're working on getting a static frontend capable of serving
PDFs from somewhere - hosting TBD.

If you would like to get in contact for questions, contributions,
or anything else, please reach out to
[vocaloidleadsheets@googlegroups.com](mailto:vocaloidleadsheets@googlegroups.com).
